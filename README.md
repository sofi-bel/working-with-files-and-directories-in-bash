## Assignment

Create a bash script (.sh) that runs the script according to the task:
             
1. Creates new directories with names from file ```my_file.txt``` (there are 14 names in the list - i.e. there must be 14 new directories) in the script's start directory.
2. The files ```cherry_pie.sh``` and ```good_coffee.sh``` are created in each directory
3. A ```post_box``` is also created in each directory, where the original ```messages.txt``` file should be copied.
4. Next, the user is prompted to enter a message (1 line, no more is needed). The user's invitation should be designed (there should be some message informing the user to enter the message).
5. In all copied ```messages.txt``` files (except source), placed in created directories, a message is added (the file must not be completely rewritten!)
